Modded Minecraft is great and there's tons of mods you likely have in your modpacks you play every day and are unaware of.

Typically a single Agricarft spinkler can be used to multiply the speed, however, the effect does stack. This can pose a problem as all the particles from this causes a considerable amount of client-side render time/lag. This means that you will need to disable the particles for optimal FPS and to not lag out while around some bases.</description></item><item><title>MultiMC</title><link>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/launchers/multimc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/launchers/multimc/</guid><description>About MultiMC MultiMC is a Minecraft launcher.
