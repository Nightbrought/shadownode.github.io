That being said, typically you would need to give them full access to inventories such as your chests, crates, ME systems, etc. You can solve this by issuing some commands that will set \u0026ldquo;flags\u0026rdquo;, these are extra settings that override the default behavior.\nThe question ultimately comes down to if you want to fully trust everyone that you want to have access to your Waystones, Viaducts, etc. or if you rather they have access exclusively to the Waystones, etc.\nHow to grant access to Waystones To fix this you simply need to run 4 commands within your claim(s) - This must be run in every single claim that you wish to use it within or they will not have permission to do so in other claims.\nThe following commands will need to be run one at a time and will allow you to have anyone who visits your claim to have access to use your Waystones, etc. but nothing else, they will not have access to build or access other items. As with other transportation items they will need to be run on all claims that you wish this to be enabled in.\n/cf interact-inventory waystones:waystone true - This allows interactions of inventory only when the inventory is a waystone. In this case it’s looking for the mod waystones and the material waystone.\n/cf interact-inventory-click waystones:waystone true - The same applies here, however, it’s applying to inventory clicking/usage.\n/cf interact-item-secondary waystones:waystone true - This allows the item to be right-clicked when it is of the proper type. This means it will bring the waystones’ UI up.\n/cf interact-block-secondary waystones:waystone true - Same as directly above, but will allow you to interact with waystones in the sense of it being a block.\nHow to grant access to Viaducts Viaducts are a bit different as well as they will require you to have the chunks loaded on both the entrance/exit. The commands will change from waystones:waystone to thermaldynamics:duct_64. This is changing the item/material’s ID to the correct one for Viaducts. You can find this out via some changes you can make within Walia or JEI.\nTo simply run the commands to enable it please issue the commands below.\n/cf interact-inventory thermaldynamics:duct_64 true\n/cf interact-inventory-click thermaldynamics:duct_64 true\n/cf interact-item-secondary thermaldynamics:duct_64 true\n/cf interact-block-secondary thermaldynamics:duct_64 true\n"},{"uri":"https://beta.shadownode.ca/tags/area/","title":"area","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://beta.shadownode.ca/tags/banned/","title":"banned","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://beta.shadownode.ca/server-info/banned/","title":"Banned Items","tags":["banneditems"],"description":"","content":"We have banned certain items on our servers because of issues in the past that now require us to disable them.

There are two types of Chunk Loaders, Always On and Online Only. To view chunk borders, hit F3+g\nAlways On vs Online Only Always On is a chunk loader which is online 24/7 and will keep the chunk loaded. However, the chunk loader will stop loading the chunk after 3 days of activity. Once the owner returns, it will resume loading the chunk.The Online Only chunk loader will only load the chunk when the owner of the loader is online.\n1.16 Chunkloaders Checking your Balance To check the number of chunks you have and may use on 1.16 servers you can run the following command to see your current chunkloaders /ificlt balance\nCreating Chunkloaders To create a chunkloader in 1.16 servers you will now need a physical block to do so as well as a blaze rod. The block that you need depends on the type of loader you have. The following blocks are used for the following type of loaders by default:\n Always Online - Diamond Block Online Only - Gold Block  Please note that these blocks can change per pack. You can also view the current blocks for your pack by typing /ificlt info.\n Once you place the correct block in the chunk you wish to load (or radius load) you need to right click it with a Blaze Rod. If you have enough free chunk loaders you can create a radius chunk loader by right clicking the chunk loader block again. Please note that you can only assign a radius up to the maximum amount of chunk loaders you have and not larger than a radius of 4 per chunk loader. Once you are happy with your chunk loader set up shift-right click it to activate the loader. You can shift-right click one of your own loaders to disable it as well. If you need to break a chunk loader to move it or want the resources back you need to first shift-right click the chunk loader block with a blaze rod. Doing so will show that you have disabled the loader and it's been returned to your balance. Doing so will also delete the chunk loader so you will no longer have it loaded!.\n Showing Loaded Chunks You can see the loaded chunks by right clicking on the loader with a peice of glow stone dust. This will create an effect that looks like a world border going out from the loader block and creating a square box of loaded chunks going out. This is super helpful with knowing what all you have loaded on radius loaders.\n1.10 And 1.12 Chunkloaders The most basic command in the plugin is /betterchunkloader, or just /bcl for short. Executing this command will open an interface in the chat that the user may interact with. The interface will contain a list of active chunk loaders you currently own, along with some user-friendly icons. An example of the interface is below. Checking Your Balance To check the number of chunks you may use/have used, you can click the Balance or run /bcl bal. The interface will state the number of both Always Online and Online Only chunks that are currently active (used) and are available. How to Create Chunk Loaders From the main interface, you should click the Create icon or run /bcl create to begin the process of creating a Chunk Loader. An interface will open and should look like the following image. The interface will state the name of the chunk loader Owner. It will also give you the coordinates of the chunk that you are currently standing in. Please note that these coordinates are different than regular XYZ coordinates. To create an Always Online chunk loader or Online Only chunk loader, click their respective icons. You should be prompted with the following interface. The Radius icons will determine the size of the chunk loader. You can only load as many chunks as your balance allows. Hovering over the icon will display how many chunks will be loaded with each radius upgrade. After you select your radius size, your chunk loader will be created. You will be shown a confirmation window which will display your name, loader id, and state. If you'd like to delete your loader and regain your chunk balance, click the Delete icon. How to View Active Chunk Loaders Once you have Chunk Loaders active, running /bcl will contain some information regarding regarding your active chunk loaders. You can hover over the Chunk icon to view the coordinates of the chunk loader. Clicking View will pull up the same prompt that was displayed after you created your loader originally. How to Read Chunk Coordinates To view the coordinates of the chunk you are currently in, press F3. You will see the typical statistics of your game, which should resemble the image below. The value in the red box is your chunk coordinates.

Every block claimed is accounted for. You can buy claim blocks from the tokenshop, or from the store. Before claiming any land, please make sure to check which method of claiming you currently are using, 2D or 3D. Once your method of choice is confirmed, we can begin claiming. If you are in 2D mode, right click two opposite corners of the intended claim. For 3D mode, right click two opposite corners, one at the lowest point in the claim, and the other at the highest point in the claim. You can right click the air or ground with a stick to see who claims the block you are looking at.\n2D vs 3D 2D means that no what Y level you claim the blocks on, Grief Prevention will make your claim from bedrock to make build level. 3D will require you to claim your area in a cube and will only claim what is inside the cube.\nHow to Subdivide Claims Subdividing your claim means making smaller sections in the bigger claim to allow people to build/access certain parts of your base. To subdivide claims, hold your golden shovel and run the command subdivideclaims. This changes your golden shovel to create smaller claims. This is always in 2D mode, but it reaches to the highest level of your main claim. When you select two corners you see iron blocks instead of golden blocks. To get out of subdivideclaims mode, scroll your mouse wheel off the golden shovel and then back onto it. This can be used to make towns and/or sell plots to other players for in-game currency.\n"},{"uri":"https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/guides/contributing/","title":"Contributing","tags":[],"description":"","content":"To contribute to this wiki all you need to do is follow this handy little guide!

To do so simply have your friend trust you manually on the island. To do so they will need to type /trust your_playername and then allow you to place your stuff on their island. Once you have fully moved your items off your island and player's inventory you should be safe to join their team without losing items.\nPleae note that ShadowNode staff will not refund any items to a player who's inventory gets wiped by joining another team / island.\nServer Reboot Crashes Client The most common client crash is upon a server reboot if you don't log out ahead of time. This crash is typically caused by a mod called MineTogether. You can easily remove the mod if you're using MultiMC you can do so with the following steps.\nBefore attempting the steps below make sure that you have a backup of your instance! Failure to do so may result in you having to redownload your pack again.\n MultiMC Please follow the steps below when the game is not running.\n Right Click on the instance and select Edit Instance from the menu that pops up. On the left hand of the window you will see a list of icons and options. Click Loader Mods. At the bottom of this new section there's a text box that is labeled filter type in MineTogether.

Manual (FTB App, GD Launcher) Please follow these diretions for any launcher other than MultiMC please follow the following steps. While doing these steps ensure the game is not currently running.\n Right click on the instance icon and select the option to open the instances folder. This can vary by app and version and is currently listed as \u0026ldquo;Open Folder\u0026rdquo; on GD Launcher. Open in the new file browser window go to the following path mods, scroll down till you see a file named like the following minetogether-1.16.5-x.x.x-forge.jar and rename it to minetogether-1.16.5-x.x.x-forge.jar.disabled.

Typically a single Agricarft spinkler can be used to multiply the speed, however, the effect does stack. This can pose a problem as all the particles from this causes a considerable amount of client-side render time/lag. This means that you will need to disable the particles for optimal FPS and to not lag out while around some bases. Thankfully, doing so is simple.\nTo disable the particles simply follow these steps while in game.\n Press Escape Click Mod Options Type Agricraft in the search box. Click Config Look for AgriCraft Client Settings and click it. You might need to scroll down. Click the Disable particles button if it says \u0026ldquo;false\u0026rdquo; it should turn green and display \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; Click done and enjoy the disabled particles.  Disable Dynamic Surroundings Fog The impact of these changes will be most noticable in any situation there's visual fog on the server. While this typically impacts FPS more than anything else it has been shown to reduce crashing from Night Vision in a few cases. Please note that this currently doesn't solve Night Vision crashses and ShadowNode does not recommend using it.\nTo disable the fog effects and improve your FPS you can do so by the following steps while in game.\n Press Escape. Click Mod Options Type Dynamic Surroundings Click Config Click Fog Options - You might need to scroll down Turn all fog options here to false. Click done and you will have disabled fog on MC Eternal.  Disable Autorefill with Inventory Tweaks Inventory Tweaks has been known to cause visual glitches to what you have in your hand and is in your inventory as a whole. As a result you might wish to disable to avoid it. Should you have the visual glitch you can typically resync it with what is actually there by simply logging out or opening an inventory other than your characters. Some examples of non-character inventories are chests, ender chests, pouches, AE2 Terminals amoung others.\nTo disable it is fairly simple and can be done from within your inventory screen.\n Press E if you're not already within the inventory screen. In the top right section of this screen you will see a button with 3 horizontal dots. Click this and it will open a configuration screen. Within this configuration screen you will see an option on the right hand side at the top listed as Auto-refill: On you will need to click it once to make it change to Auto-refill: Off.

Aiming to provide players with the best experience possible, ShadowNode is proud to host over 15 diverse servers!\nRules These rules apply for our Forums, Discord, servers and all other services. By using our services, you are agreeing to follow these rules. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse. Staff are provided with a general guideline of punishments for each rule, however choose a punishment is at their discretion.\nRespect Staff and Staff Decisions  Do not in any way mock, abuse, argue with, or be disrespectful in general to any member of our staff. If you feel you have been mistreated by a staff member or believe a punishment you received is unjust, do not mock them or make a scene. Contact another member of the staff team to discuss the issue privately.  No Harassment, Flaming or Trolling  This includes repeated requests for something over DMs, frequent unwanted TPA requests, bullying someone in server chat or DMs, and any other kind of unwanted contact or abuse. We understand that friends may joke around with each other, but if a staff member asks you to stop, you should listen. Any joking around that includes cussing, vulgar sexual comments or hate speech will be punished as such.  No Foul Language, Hate Speech, Sexual Comments,Political/Religious Discussions, Drug Use Discussions  We want to provide a safe, positive and clean environment for everyone, so we have this rule to achieve that goal. Private conversations via whispers of this nature are allowed, provided one person is not harassing the other. Discussing ANY topic which talks about abusing drugs, whether they're legal drugs or illegal drugs, is not allowed.  No Advertising, Spamming or Attention-Seeking  This includes advertising other servers or Discords, spamming random stuff in chat, or just general spamming to get attention for something, such as trying to sell something. Bear in mind, that asking for the same thing every few minutes DOES count as spamming.  No Excessive Mobs/Items Inside Mob Spawners  Spawners MUST auto-kill mobs as soon as they spawn. You are NOT allowed to have a spawner which requires a player to kill the mobs inside. Spawners must NOT clog with mobs or items. It is your responsibility to ensure that this doesn't happen.  No Cheating, Hacking, Glitching, Duping  This includes using third-party programs, plugins and/or bugs to gain an unfair advantage in gameplay over other players. X-Ray bugs/resource packs are not allowed. Optifine, BetterFPS and similar framerate-boosting mods ARE allowed, but may cause technical issues with your Minecraft client.  No Begging From Staff Members Our staff members have access to Creative mode to deal with technical issues and discover bugs, not to give you free stuff. See the Refunds policy if you've lost something due to a glitch/bug\nNo Alt Accounts, Using Another User's Account  Alt accounts, by definition, are other accounts that a player has access to. Alt accounts are often used to circumvent punishments that the staff have placed upon a different account. If you allow someone to use your account, and the account is banned, we will not lift the ban. You are responsible for your own account and anyone you let onto the account.  Don't Minimod - Let Staff Do Their Jobs  Mini-modding is telling people what the rules are and what they should do without first consulting staff to see if it is okay to tell those people. You may only teach other users about the rules if a staff member has explicitly given you permission to do so. If a user is asking about rules and no staff member is around to assist them, you may link them to this page.  Do Not Evade Our AFK Timer, Modifications or Limitations   Evading the AFK Timer includes, but is not limited to:\n Any item, machine, third-party program, or building which would cause the AFK detection system to not kick you while you are away from your computer.    Evading Modifications/Limitations includes, but is not limited to:\n Breaking blocks in areas you are not supposed to be able to modify, bypassing the profanity filter, and the use of banned items.    If you are a designated tester for the server, then this is allowed only while staff are present and watching\n  No Refunds of Items Lost, Unless the Loss of Items was Caused by a Proven Glitch with Our Services  We do not refund items lost to graves failing to spawn, clicking the Baubles menu with an item by accident, accidentally throwing an item in a Trash Can, or any similar issue. These are mod bugs and user error, neither of which we are responsible for. We do not refund items lost in unclaimed bases being raided or griefed. You are responsible for securing your own base. WE will use Prism to roll back/undo the damage, but that is all we will do. We do not refund easy-to-replace items such as sand, wood, dirt, Oak Fence, etc. Staff will decide on a case-by-case basis if an item should be refunded.  Do Not Auto-mine in the Overworld  We have mining worlds for a reason, so the terrain of the overworld doesn't get scarred by constant mining with Quarries or other mass-mining devices. If a quarry or quarry-like device is found in the overworld, it will be broken by a staff member. You may use a Quarry and/or similar devices for clearing space during base-building. 2x2 chunks maximum, with a 20 Y-level maximum.  Use English Only in the Main Chat  This is purely to help the staff troubleshoot thing sand keep the chat clear of confusing messages. Talking in other langues via private messages is allowed.  No Griefing  Griefing means to negatively change a building or area which you do not own or have permission to use. This includes, but is not limited to the following:  Breaking blocks from other's builds, stealing items or resources from others. This also applies to buildings and areas where the area is player owner, but it is not evident who exactly owned it.    No raiding or Stealing, Even if the Base is Unclaimed  Includes all resource types.  Mana, power and livestock are also considered resources.    Do Not Use Discord to Evade Mute Punishments  If a staff member mutes you, it's for a reason. Don't use our Discord services to bypass our punishment. Using the ban appeals forum to discuss your mute is allowed.  Do Not Impersonate a Staff Member  Impersonation means pretending to be someone else. This includes changing your nickname to a staff member's username/nickname or adding Staff/Admin/Etc to nay part of your nickname or rank.   Store Policies These policies apply for all purchases to ShadowNode and services or goods provided by ShadowNode. Punishments may include forfeiting of product or perks without refund permanently or for a given time.\nAll Transactions are Final  This means that you will not get any refunds for purchases, regardless of the circumstances, as you should've read what you wil be getting in depth in the first place.  No Abuse of a Product or its Perks  If you abuse any store items/ranks/privileges you will be subject to punishment without refund.  No Chargebacks  Chargebacks are when a customer reverses a transaction which has already been processed, usually done when goods are defective and therefore return the goods with a refund. As we do not do refunds here due to the digital nature of the services we provide, any chargebacks aimed at our services will be treated as an effort to defraud us.  No Purchases from Unconfirmed or Unauthorized Accounts  Purchases from unconfirmed accounts are not allowed. If a purchase was made from an account you are not authorized to use, the owner may contact us by email at payments@shadownode.ca to discuss refund. Once an account holder has contacted us and has been verified as the legitimate owner, we will terminate the account associated with the payment and they will be unable to access our services permanently.

Items  Currently we only have the \u0026ldquo;Pay What You Want\u0026rdquo; option in here. This item has no reward, so please only use this function if you really want to support us without expecting anything in return.

Each of which you can use to vote on, once per day. You vote by filling in your Minecraft username in the text window and completing the Captcha. Voting gives you 100 Tokens per voting website, which can be used for in-game items or transactions with other users.  Why should you vote?  Voting increases our rank and reputation on those websites, which means there is a higher chance for new players to get interested in ShadowNode. The tokens you get from voting are a global form of currency which you can trade in for claimblocks, chunkloaders and other goodies on the servers you play on. We have a monthly giveaway of Steam Game Keys for permanent copies of certain games for the Top 3 Voters! Claim your key by making a support ticket in our Discord! Every vote supports us and is just as valuable to us as you supporting us via our store!  Rewards redeemed from the token shop are usually not globally shared. Your token balance is globally shared between all servers however.\n Where can I redeem my rewards?  After voting you get a shoutout in-game confirming that your vote went through. This shoutout does not always show up client side, but other players see it. The rewards for your tokens can be claimed in the /tokenshop on your server. If you are one of the Top 3 Voters of the month message a staff member to get your Steam Game Key in the first week of the new month. The Voters can choose the game they want with Number 1 having the choice between all 3 titles and Number 2 being allowed to choose from the remaining games.  You can check the amount of tokens you have by using /tokenbal on any server.\n "},{"uri":"https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/","title":"Wiki","tags":[],"description":"","content":"In this category you will find all commands, guides, rules and answers to questions you may have about our server!\nIf you feel like something is missing from this wiki, just follow the steps laid out in our Contributing Page\n"},{"uri":"https://beta.shadownode.ca/home/wipes/","title":"Wipes and Restarts","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Servers restart every once in a while to reduce lag.
