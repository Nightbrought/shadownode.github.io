If you encounter a bug, or any issue with the items, please report it in our Discord Support channel. Our plugin allows us to ban the items in a way that allows you to still progress through the pack. Craft, Place, Use, and Near are all the different ways items can be banned.</description></item><item><title>Ranks</title><link>https://beta.shadownode.ca/server-info/ranks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://beta.shadownode.ca/server-info/ranks/</guid><description>Available Ranks On the server we have multiple ranks that you can contribute to acquire.
The first few include some commands with many being useful and some fun ones included with a few.
Each rank also has their own custom join/leave message.
Also every rank inherits the commands/features from the previous ranks.
Price of each rank is also located on the contribute page.
